Welcome to my Python code directory.
I recently started my practical studies on projects that I find on the internet.
Would like to share them here with people who are at the same time as me, trying to perfect their techniques.
Feel free to explore all the lines of code in this directory.
I warn you that none of them are actually created from scratch by me, but they all have my personal touch to leave my mark.
